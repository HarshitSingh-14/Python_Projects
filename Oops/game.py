            #  -> large scale , a lot of data,  many global variables...
class Remote():
    pass


             #     Object of a given class invoke methods without implementing details of 
             #     user  ==>   Abstraction -->> is hiding the unnecessary details from the users
class Player:                 #  Encapulation -->> all functions organised as in respected CLASS
